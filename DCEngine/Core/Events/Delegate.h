\brief  A delegate is a class that wraps a pointer or reference to an object 
        instance, a member method of that object's class to be called on that
        object instance, and provides a method to trigger that call.
\note   I am too inexperienced a programmer to have been able to come up
        with the implementation on my own. Thus, I researched and ended up
        reading through several implementations:

        I also got a lot of help from one of my mentors, Arend Danielek, after
        he walked me through the way he implemented the event system in his Junior
        game, "Coffee Break".
