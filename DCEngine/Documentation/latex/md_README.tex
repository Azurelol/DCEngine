This repository is for my Digi\-Pen G\-A\-M 200 Engine, \char`\"{}\-Daisy Chain\char`\"{}.

My G\-A\-M 200 team, \char`\"{}\-Moonward\char`\"{}. The developer team\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Christian Sagel
\item Connor Tilley
\item John Myres
\item Allan Deutsch
\item Chen Shu
\item Blaine Reiner
\end{DoxyItemize}

And our esteemed artists\-:

This E\-C\-S engine me and my team are writing, \char`\"{}\-Daisy Chain\char`\"{} will be directly based on \char`\"{}reverse-\/engineering\char`\"{} Allan Deutsch's \href{https://github.com/Masstronaut/aljeengine}{\tt A\-J\-Engine.}, as well as \href{http://zero.digipen.edu/}{\tt Digi\-Pen's Zero Engine}. It is implements graphics with G\-L\-E\-W and Modern Open\-G\-L by following these fantastic tutorials\-: \href{http://learnopengl.com/}{\tt Learn Open\-G\-L}

While A\-J\-Engine is a gamestate-\/driven engine that follows a model us sophomores will be used to by now (after C\-S 230), I am writing Daisy Chain engine in mind to enable gameplay through components and objects added to a 'game' object and the spaces it contains. In that regard, I want that part to be similar to how the Zero Engine works.

There is a roadmap of the engine itself in terms of features to be implemented next, bugs, and technical questions that stump me\-:

I am also documenting my day-\/to-\/day progress in a log of sorts\-:

(If you know a better alternative for logging something like this, that's easy/fast to use let me know!)
