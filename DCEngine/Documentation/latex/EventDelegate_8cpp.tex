\hyperlink{classA}{A} delegate is a class that wraps a pointer or reference to an object instance, a member method of that object's class to be called on that object instance, and provides a method to trigger that call.

I am too inexperienced a programmer to have been able to come up with the implementation on my own. Thus, I researched and ended up reading through several implementations\-:

I also got a lot of help from one of my mentors, Arend Danielek, after he walked me through the way he implemented the event system in his Junior game, \char`\"{}\-Coffee Break\char`\"{}.

9/11/2015\-: I finally finished the delegate implementation, in no small measure thanks to Gab and Arend.
