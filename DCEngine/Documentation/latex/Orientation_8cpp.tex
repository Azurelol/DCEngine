\hyperlink{classThe}{The} orientation component is an utility component that helps make the manipulation of the transform of an object easier. It can be particularly useful when the object has its own sense of forward. By using the orientation component, the object can then be easily manipulated relatively to the object's forward instead of being restricted to the world axis.
