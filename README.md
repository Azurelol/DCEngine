This repository holds my DigiPen's GAM 250 Engine, "Daisy Chain Engine". 
 
My GAM 250 team, "Moonward". The developer team:
- Christian Sagel
- William Mao
- Jason Jorgensen
- Gabriel Neumann
- Connor Tilley
- John Myres
- Allan Deutsch
- Blaine Reiner

And our esteemed artists:
- Mariah Millard
- Abigail Snider

This ECS engine me and my team wrote, "Daisy Chain" had very humble beginnings. It first started as a reverse-engineering attempt off Allan Deutsch's [AJEngine.](https://github.com/Masstronaut/aljeengine), as well as [DigiPen's Zero Engine](http://zero.digipen.edu/). It uses the following libraries for its main systems:
- Window/Input: SFML
- Graphics: OpenGL (Core Profile)
- Audio: FMOD Studio
- UI: dear imgui
- Scripting: Zilch
- Serialization: JSON

There is a roadmap of sorts that was used during the engine's development:

[Daisy Chain Engine Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/vDmSAbFm/daisy-chain-engine-roadmap)

I also documented my day-to-day progress in a log of sorts:

(If you know a better alternative for logging something like this, that's easy/fast to use let me know!)
