# DCEngine

This repository is for my DigiPen GAM 250 Engine, "Daisy Chain". 

My GAM 250 team, "Moonward". The developer team:
- Christian Sagel
- William Mao
- Jason Jorgensen
- Gabriel Neumann
- Connor Tilley
- John Myres
- Allan Deutsch
- Blaine Reiner

And our esteemed artists:
- Mariah Millard
- Abigail Snider

This ECS engine me and my team are writing, "Daisy Chain" will be directly based on "reverse-engineering" Allan Deutsch's [AJEngine.](https://github.com/Masstronaut/aljeengine), as well as [DigiPen's Zero Engine](http://zero.digipen.edu/). It is implements graphics with GLEW and Modern OpenGL by following these fantastic tutorials: [Learn OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com/)

While AJEngine is a gamestate-driven engine that follows a model us sophomores will be used to by now (after CS 230), I am writing Daisy Chain engine in mind to enable gameplay through components and objects added to a 'game' object and the spaces it contains. In that regard, I want that part to be similar to how the Zero Engine works. 

There is a roadmap of the engine itself in terms of features to be implemented next, bugs, and technical questions that stump me:

I am also documenting my day-to-day progress in a log of sorts:

(If you know a better alternative for logging something like this, that's easy/fast to use let me know!)
