# GAM200

This repository is for my DigiPen GAM 200 team, "Moonward":
- Christian Sagel
- Connor Tilley
- John Myres
- Allan Deutsch

It will contain my notes, research into writing an ECS engine as well as a project in Unity to prototype gameplay for the game we will be making.

The ECS engine I will be writing first, "Daisy Chain" will be directly based on reverse-engineering Allan Deutsch's [AJEngine.](https://github.com/Masstronaut/aljeengine), as well as implementing graphics with GLEW and Modern OpenGL by following these fantastic tutorials: [Learn OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com/)

I am also documenting my day-to-day progress in a log of sorts:

(If you know a better alternative for logging something like this, that's easy/fast to use let me know!)
