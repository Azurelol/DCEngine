# GAM200

This repository is for my DigiPen GAM 200 Engine, "Daisy Chain". 

My GAM 200 team, "Moonward":
- Christian Sagel
- Connor Tilley
- John Myres
- Allan Deutsch

Note that at this time, this won't be the engine that the team will be using, but the one I am personally writing to learn graphics programming, engine architecture, software practices, etc.

The ECS engine I am writing, "Daisy Chain" will be directly based on reverse-engineering Allan Deutsch's [AJEngine.](https://github.com/Masstronaut/aljeengine), as well as implementing graphics with GLEW and Modern OpenGL by following these fantastic tutorials: [Learn OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com/)

I have plugged in the tutorial code into the engine, adding functionality through classes to the engine 
(such as shader objects, camera class) as I learn them. 

While AJEngine is a gamestate-driven engine that follows a model us sophomores will be used to by now (after CS 230), I am writing Daisy Chain engine in mind to enable gameplay through components and objects added to a 'game' object and the spaces it contains. In that regard, I want that part to be similar to how the Zero Engine works. 

I am also documenting my day-to-day progress in a log of sorts:

(If you know a better alternative for logging something like this, that's easy/fast to use let me know!)
