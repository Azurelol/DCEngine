# GAM200

This repository is for my DigiPen GAM 200 team, "Moonward":
- Christian Sagel
- Connor Tilley
- John Myres
- Allan Deutsch

It will contain my notes, research into writing an ECS engine as well as a project in Unity to prototype gameplay for the game we will be making.

The ECS engine I will be writing first, "Daisy Chain" will be directly based on reverse-engineering Allan Deutsch's [AJEngine.](https://github.com/Masstronaut/aljeengine) (Ok, I know it's not really reverse engineering if the code is fully exposed. I just wanna sound cool!!!)

I am also documenting my day-to-day progress in a log of sorts:

[Daisy Chain Development Progress Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1owN00AVVGzIan5TGH_BJrXHaZ0YIHjNjQBijRDP-hFw/edit?usp=sharing)

(If you know a better alternative for logging something like this, that's easy/fast to use let me know!)
